## "id_list" file = text file with one sample id per line 
## "RG" file with read group information for each sample in same order as id file - this is necessary for variant calling with GATK 
## (eg: @RG\tID:BSAF7_3_RES_d\tSM:BSAF7_3_RES\tPU:none\tLB:F01\tPL:ILLUMINA)

# In this case the job parallel is executing is just calling the script, so internal logging with the "--joblog"
#   argument isn't really useful, just indicates whether scipts was called, not whether it worked.
#   I do logging in internal script to check later.
